                TLDR: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of electronic cash. It is a decentralized digital currency
                without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer
                bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.<br><br>

                If you want to know what is Bitcoin, how you can get it and how it can help you, without floundering
                into technical details, this guide is for you. It will explain how the system works, how you can use it
                for your profit, which scams to avoid. It will also direct you to resources that will help you store and
                use your first pieces of digital currency. If you are looking for something even more in detail please

                Small wonder that Bitcoin emerged in 2008 just after Occupy Wall Street accused big banks of misusing
                borrowersâ€™ money, duping clients, rigging the system, and charging boggling fees. Bitcoin pioneers
                wanted to put the seller in charge, eliminate the middleman, cancel interest fees, and make transactions
                transparent, to hack corruption and cut fees. They created a decentralized system, where you could
                control your funds and know what was going on.<br><br>

                Bitcoin has come far in a relatively short time. All over the world, companies, from REEDS Jewelers, a
                large jewelry chain in the US, to a private hospital in Warsaw, Poland, accept its currency. Billion
                dollar businesses such as Dell, Expedia, PayPal, and Microsoft do, too. Websites promote it,
                publications such as Bitcoin Magazine publish its news, forums discuss cryptocurrency and trade its
                coins. It has its application programming interface (API), price index, and exchange rate.<br><br><br>
                A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain.
                Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign
                transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The
                signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All
                transactions are broadcast to the network and usually begin to be confirmed within 10-20 minutes,
                through a process called mining.<br><br><br>
                Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm pending transactions by including them
                in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the
                network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed,
                transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified
                by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would
                invalidate all the subsequent blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that
                prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively to the block chain. In this way, no
                group or individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain
                to roll back their own spends.<br><br><br>
                This is just a short summary of Bitcoin. If you want to learn more of the details, you can read the
                original paper that describes its design, the developer documentation, or explore the Bitcoin wiki.
