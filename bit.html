                TLDR: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of electronic cash. It is a decentralized digital currency
                without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer
                bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.<br><br>

                Small wonder that Bitcoin emerged in 2008 just after Occupy Wall Street accused big banks of misusing
                borrowersâ€™ money, duping clients, rigging the system, and charging boggling fees. Bitcoin pioneers
                wanted to put the seller in charge, eliminate the middleman, cancel interest fees, and make transactions
                transparent, to hack corruption and cut fees. They created a decentralized system, where you could
                control your funds and know what was going on.<br><br>

                Bitcoin has come far in a relatively short time. All over the world, companies, from REEDS Jewelers, a
                large jewelry chain in the US, to a private hospital in Warsaw, Poland, accept its currency. Billion
                dollar businesses such as Dell, Expedia, PayPal, and Microsoft do, too. Websites promote it,
                publications such as Bitcoin Magazine publish its news, forums discuss cryptocurrency and trade its
                coins. It has its application programming interface (API), price index, and exchange rate.<br><br>
