                    What is Digital Technology<br><br>
                    1. The word “digital” comes from Latin—digitus, finger—and refers to one of the oldest tools for
                    counting. When information is stored, transmitted or forwarded in digital format, it is converted
                    into numbers—at the most basic machine-level as “zeroes and ones.” In the context of this chapter,
                    the term represents technology that relies on the use of microprocessors; hence, computers and
                    applications that are dependent on computers such as the Internet, as well as other devices such as
                    video cameras, and mobile devices such as phones and personal-digital assistants (PDAs). Learn more

                    2. Entails the use of devices
                    that enable access to cyberspace, the use of digital audio/video and information communications
                    technology (ICT). Learn more in: Digital Natives, Learner Perceptions and the Use of ICT
                    <br><br>
                    3. The provision and the use of electronic technologies required to install, integrate, STEM, and
                    other
                    technology systems. Digital technology also involves working principles, processes, and standards
                    which apply to the technology industry. Learn more in: Saudi Arabia's Female Middle School

                    communication. The
                    Boone-Kabul program specifically used computers, smartphones, and applications such as Skype, Gmail,
                    and Facebook. Learn more in: The Boone-Kabul Project: How Art Taught Us to Know and See Each

                    6. Any technological device that functions through a binary computational code such as mobile
                    phones, tablets, laptops, computers, etc. Learn more in: Developing English Language Teachers'
                    Professional Capacities through Digital and Media Literacies: A Brazilian Perspective<br><br> 7. It

                    of
                    technology – as opposed to analogue technology – based on notation of all signals (e.g., sounds,
                    pictures, data) in uniform 0–1 form. Digital technology includes computing, communication and
                    content. Learn more in: Digital Future(s) <br><br>9. Any information used on a computer or
                    disseminated on a
                    computer is known as digital technology. Digital technology can enhance the level of creativity and
                    distribution of information... Some examples of digital technology are …“computer programs and
                    software; web pages and websites, including social media; data and databases; digital audio such as
                    mp3s; and books are examples of digital media” ( www.icliteracy.info AU41: URL Validation failed:
