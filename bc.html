                The blockchain is an undeniably ingenious invention – the brainchild of a person or group of people
                known by the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. But since then, it has evolved into something greater, and the
                main question every single person is asking is: What is Blockchain?<br><br>

                By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the
                backbone of a new type of internet. Originally devised for the digital currency, Bitcoin, (Buy Bitcoin)
                the tech community has now found other potential uses for the technology.<br><br>

                In thisguide, we are going to explain to you what the blockchain technology is, and what its properties
                are that make it so unique. So, we hope you enjoy this, What Is Blockchain Guide. And if you already
                know what blockchain is and want to become a blockchain developer please check out our in-depth
                blockchain tutorial and create your very first blockchain.<br><br><br>
                We rely on economic theory to discuss how blockchain technology will shape the rate and direction of
                innovation. We identify two key costs affected by the technology: 1) the cost of verification; and 2)
                the cost of networking. The first cost relates to the ability to cheaply verify the attributes of a
                transaction. The second one to the ability to bootstrap and operate a marketplace without the need for a
                traditional intermediary: When combined with a native token (as in Bitcoin and Ethereum), a blockchain
                allows a decentralized network of economic agents to agree, at regular intervals, about the true state
                of shared data. This shared data can represent exchanges of currency, intellectual property, equity,
                information or other types of contracts and digital assets - making blockchain a general purpose
                technology that can be used to trade scarce, digital property rights and create novel types of digital
                platforms. The resulting marketplaces are characterized by increased competition, lower barriers to
                entry and innovation, lower privacy and censorship risk, and allow participants within the same
                ecosystem to make investments to support and operate shared infrastructure without assigning market
                power to a platform operator. They also challenge the existing revenue models and accumulated knowledge
                and resources of incumbents, and open opportunities for new approaches to startup fundraising, the
                provision of public goods and software protocols, data ownership and licensing, auctions and reputation
                systems.<br><br><br>
                Blocksize and Transaction Costs
                As of early 2018, the number of transactions that Bitcoin is able to process is limited to just 3-4 per
                second, compared to the 30,000 credit-card transactions per second by Visa. Since the demand for Bitcoin
                transactions is greater than this (self-imposed) limit transaction fees have emerged to determine which
                transactions get processed. In 2017 the total transaction fees paid on Bitcoin transactions was US$277.1
                million.<br><br><br>

                The limited number of Bitcoin transactions is self-imposed due to the maximum size of each block, which
                is currently set to around 2mb. There is no reason this could not be changed, so that each block took up
                more storage space and so could record more transactions. It would simply require a technical adjustment
                to the code implementing the Bitcoin protocol, and this change is periodically proposed needing a simple
                majority of miners to adopt it. (Such changes are sometimes made, in fact prior to 2010 the blocksize
                was 36mb.) The main argument against is that any increase in the blocksize would makes the blockchain
                much larger and more expensive to store, as well as increasing bandwidth requirements. This is
                especially true as the number of transactions is linear in the blocksize, so an increase from 2mb to
                20mb per block would increase from 3-4 to 60-80 transactions per second. To those who wish to view
                Bitcoin as money this is problematic, but is not a problem for those who view Bitcoin as a digital
                alternative to gold.<br><br><br>

                The limited supply of transactions, combined with an increased demand for transactions, has led directly
                to the existence and growth of transaction fees which miners charge to include a given transaction in a
                block. These transaction fees match the demand for Bitcoin transactions with the fixed supply, and
                increase during periods when there is high demand for transactions (Easley, O’Hara & Basu, 2017). While
                these transaction fees do match the demand to the supply by reducing the quantity demanded it is worth
                repeating that they do not help to increase the quantity supplied as this is strictly limited by the
                blocksize which is coded into the protocols implementing Bitcoin. The transactions fees do however
                increase the returns to mining, resulting in more computing power being used to process the same number
                of transactions; the difficulty of the numerical problems solved by miners increases to ensure that the
                rate at which blocks are added does not change in response to the increased mining.<br><br><br>
