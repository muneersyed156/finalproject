                Cyber security refers to the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect
                networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Cyber security may
                also be referred to as information technology security.<br>
                <br><br>
                The National Cyber Security Alliance, through SafeOnline.org, recommends a top-down approach to cyber
                security in which corporate management leads the charge in prioritizing cyber security management across
                all business practices. NCSA advises that companies must be prepared to “respond to the inevitable cyber
                incident, restore normal operations, and ensure that company assets and the company’s reputation are
                protected.” NCSA’s guidelines for conducting cyber risk assessments focus on three key areas:
                identifying your organization’s “crown jewels,” or your most valuable information requiring protection;
                identifying the threats and risks facing that information; and outlining the damage your organization
                would incur should that data be lost or wrongfully exposed. Cyber risk assessments should also consider
                any regulations that impact the way your company collects, stores, and secures data, such as PCI-DSS,
                HIPAA, SOX, FISMA, and others. Following a cyber risk assessment, develop and implement a plan to
                mitigate cyber risk, protect the “crown jewels” outlined in your assessment, and effectively detect and
                respond to security incidents. This plan should encompass both the processes and technologies required
                to build a mature cyber security program. An ever-evolving field, cyber security best practices must
                evolve to accommodate the increasingly sophisticated attacks carried out by attackers. Combining sound
                cyber security measures with an educated and security-minded employee base provides the best defense
                against cyber criminals attempting to gain access to your company’s sensitive data. While it may seem
                like a daunting task, start small and focus on your most sensitive data, scaling your efforts as your
                cyber program matures.<br><br><br>
                WE WISH to develop an elemental theory—or philosophy—of Cybersecurity. And it is to be a theory so
                fundamental in nature, so complete and broadly applicable—that it must form an actual Science Of
                Cybersecurity.<br><br><br>

                Now we have already asked the question: What Kind Of A Science Is Cybersecurity?<br><br><br>

                And we provided an answer—of sorts. We concluded that Cybersecurity is impossible to develop as a
                logical subject of study—without first establishing an observational science that identifies what we are
                dealing with in the first place. Our approach is akin to a Newtonian science that places emphasis on
                fundamental objects, processes, forces and their composability. Henceforth our new science of
                Cybersecurity will be—above all—a science that focusses on definition, classification, axioms and
                establishing taxonomies of threats and countermeasures—plus topic: structure/relationship ‘maps’ for all
                concepts etc.<br><br><br>

                Our key aim is established. Desired is a foundational theory for the entire subject matter of
                Cybersecurity. One theory to rule them all, so-to-speak.<br><br><br>

                Qualification<br><br><br>
                Theory is—all very well and good—but it must have purpose and be practical. In other words any valid
                theory must be held to account, and be testable, provable—plus useful.<br><br><br>

                It therefore seems clear that Cybersecurity theory must be—in one sense—a purely objective property.
                However because it is influenced by perceptions/judgements/predictions—it is at the same time a
                subjective property.<br><br><br>

                Evidently, factors such as: inadequate knowledge of any/all unsafe-actors; plus hidden and changing
                threat types—can cause incorrect and/or revised predictions in this respect. Henceforth making
                judgment(s)—as to the various capability, coverage and control aspects of security theory is especially
                difficult—because these are inevitably human assessed factors (automatic monitoring systems
                aside).<br><br><br>

                Security status is simultaneously a goal, metric, judgment and prediction; in addition to being a
                real-world fact/truth. Accordingly, many interrelating factors are evident for a particular system
                operating at any specific epoch.<br><br><br>

                At the very least—the person making the cybersecurity judgment(s)/decision(s) seeks to:<br><br><br>

                Be in possession of all the facts—or make accurate predictions on real-world: threats/defensive
                capabilities, and judge the effectiveness of threat-models; plus accuracy of monitoring system(s) etc;
                and<br><br><br>
                Adequately perceive/understand labyrinthine relationship(s) between multiple, complex, fixed and/or
                changing factors for relevant: systems/tools/networks/ actors/attackers etc—including future ones; and
                Implement valid cybersecurity measures, plus avoid/correct mistakes etc.
                The defender seeks to accurately: perceive, measure and understand all relevant factors; and so to
                assess which ones will influence overall cybersecurity strategy. Ergo privacy status may be partly a
                perception, model, prediction, belief and/or truth/falsehood; depending upon your point of view and
                information/knowledge level(s).<br><br><br><br>
