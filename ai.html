                Back in the 1950s, the fathers of the field Minsky and McCarthy, described artificial intelligence as
                any task performed by a program or a machine that, if a human carried out the same activity, we would
                say the human had to apply intelligence to accomplish the task.<br>

                That obviously is a fairly broad definition, which is why you will sometimes see arguments over whether
                something is truly AI or not.<br><br>

                AI systems will typically demonstrate at least some of the following behaviors associated with human
                intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception,
                motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.<br><br>

                WHAT ARE THE USES FOR AI?<br>
                AI is ubiquitous today, used to recommend what you should buy next online, to understand what you say to
                virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, to recognise who and what is in a photo, to
                spot spam, or detect credit card fraud.
                <br><br>
                Humans tend to think in straight lines, but every aspect of technological progress is actually
                accelerating – including AI. Futurist Ray Kurzweil calls this the “Law of Accelerating Returns”, and
                presents evidence that an amount of progress equal to the entire 20th century's gains was attained
                between 2000 and 2014. He also argues that the same amount will happen again before 2021. Understanding
                the exponential nature of progress and ignoring the inner tendency to think things will keep improving
                at the same rate is key to getting to grips with how fast we'll make scientific advances in the
                future.<br><br>
                Siri, Google Now, and Cortana are obvious examples of artificial intelligence, but AI is actually all
                around us. It can be found in vacuum cleaners, cars, lawnmowers, video games, Hollywood special effects,
                e-commerce software, medical research and international finance markets – among many other examples.
                John McCarthy, who originally coined the term “artificial intelligence” in 1956, famously quipped: “As
                soon as it works, no-one calls it AI anymore.”<br><br><br>
                Yeah, I know you're a special flower and everything, but the work you do is either already automatable
                or will be very soon. How soon? Most jobs will be done by robots within 30 years, says professor Moshe
                Vardi of Rice University, leading to unemployment rates greater than 50%. That might sound bad, but many
                academics studying the field believe that technological unemployment will open the door to a future
                where work is something people do for pleasure, not out of necessity. Proposals such as universal basic
                income are the beginnings of a societal support structure that could eventually allow this to become a
                reality.<br><br><br>
                In 2013, two researchers surveyed hundreds of AI experts on when they thought there was a 50/50 chance
                that human-level artificial intelligence will arrive. The median answer was 2040 – only 24 years from
                now. The average life expectancy in the UK is 82 years, meaning that there's a heads/tails chance that a
                58-year-old today will see computers as smart as humans in their lifetime. Another recent study from
                author James Barrat simply asked researchers when human-level AI would be achieved – by 2030, 2050,
                2100, after 2100 or never. The largest group, 42% of respondents, said before 2030.
