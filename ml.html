                Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn
                for themselves.<br><br>

                The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or
                instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the
                examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human
                intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.<br><br>

                Some machine learning methods
                Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.<br><br>

                Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using
                labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the
                learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system
                is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also
                compare its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify the model
                accordingly.<br><br>
                In contrast, unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is
                neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to
                describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t figure out the right output, but it
                explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled
                data.<br></br>
                Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised
                learning, since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of
                labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems that use this method are able to
                considerably improve learning accuracy. Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when the acquired
                labeled data requires skilled and relevant resources in order to train it / learn from it. Otherwise,
                acquiringunlabeled data generally doesn’t require additional resources.
                Reinforcement machine learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by
                producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the
                most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents
                to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its
                performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is
                known as the reinforcement signal.<br><br>
                Machine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster,
                more accurate results in order to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also
                require additional time and resources to train it properly. Combining machine learning with AI and
                cognitive technologies can make it even more effective in processing large volumes of information.
